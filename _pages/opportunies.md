            <h2>Stanford SVL Research Residency Program</h2>
            <p><a href="http://svl.stanford.edu">Stanford Vision and Learning (SVL) Lab</a> is initiating a new research residency program, designed to give you hands-on experiences in cutting-edge research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. This program offers a full-time research position, where residents will work with professors, postdocs, and graduate students in SVL. We are working on challenging open problems in robotic manipulation and developing new machine learning and computer vision methods to scale up robots from laboratories to the real world. Visit our <a href="{{ site.url }}/publications">publication website</a> for examples of robot learning research performed in our lab.</p>

            <p>This robotics residency program is a full-time position for 18 to 24 months. We expect the residents to gain the technical knowledge and practical expertise of AI and robotics research throughout the residency. This program is designed to prepare them for the subsequent graduate study or kickstart a career in the AI and robotics industry. We are looking for people with both a strong experience of building real robotics systems and a deep enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Accepted residents will be based on Stanford campus, and will work together with researchers in SVL to develop hardware systems and AI algorithms for a variety of robot platforms.</p>
